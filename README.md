# Hi there! I'm Rémi 👋

I'm a recent graduate 👨‍🎓 from IIT with a degree in Artificial Intelligence. I'm passionate about combining my knowledge of software development, infrastructure, and design with AI to create innovative solutions and make a positive impact 🌱.

## 🔭 What I'm currently working on

- [cunw](https://github.com/RemiKalbe/cunw): A CLI tool that generates a structured Markdown representation of a codebase, making it easy to provide context to a large language model (LLM).
- [loggraph-rs]: A rust graph datastructure library able to handle massive graphs by following the [Log(Graph) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15879).
